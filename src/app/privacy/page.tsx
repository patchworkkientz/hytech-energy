                <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
                <strong>Privacy is our priority</strong>
                <p>We are committed to protecting our customers’ personal and financial information. In the course of providing financial products and services, we need to collect and maintain certain nonpublic personal information. This Privacy Statement answers some questions about what nonpublic personal information we collect, what we do with it, and how we protect it.
                    We do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about our customers or former customers to any non-affiliated third parties, except as described below.
                </p>
                <strong>Types of nonpublic personal information we might disclose</strong>
                <p>We may disclose nonpublic personal information we collect, primarily to make available to you the financial products and services that we and our business partners provide.
                    We may disclose nonpublic personal information among our affiliated companies and to other financial services providers with which we have joint marketing agreements or that offer financial products and services with us or on our behalf. By sharing this information, we can provide you with a broader range of financial products and services, improve your experience with us, and better serve your financial needs.
                    We may also disclose information that we collect from you such as your name, contact information, and customer relationships with us to nonaffiliated third parties that perform services, such as marketing or market research, on our behalf. For example, we may provide your name, address, phone number, and/or e-mail address to vendors who send our e-mail or regular mail.
                </p>
                <strong>Other types of entities to whom we might disclose nonpublic personal information</strong>
                <p>We also may disclose information about you to companies that service, maintain, or process for us your transactions and accounts. For example, we provide information to companies that prepare and mail account statements and transaction confirmations.
                    In addition, we disclose nonpublic personal information to nonaffiliated third parties, as permitted or required by law or to cooperate with regulators or law enforcement authorities. These parties include government/regulatory organizations, such as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), as well as any of the securities exchanges and states we are registered with and to parties under court order or subpoena that request this information. Disclosures for which you have provided your consent or you have directed us to make are also permitted.
                </p>
                <strong>Opt-outs</strong>
                <p>
                    The law allows you to opt-out of our sharing nonpublic personal information about you in certain circumstances with affiliated and nonaffiliated companies; that is, you may direct us to not make such disclosures. We do not currently share information about you with any affiliate or third party that triggers this opt-out right. Therefore, there is no need for you to opt-out. If in the future we desire to disclose your information in a way that is inconsistent with this policy, we will notify you in advance and provide you with the opportunity to opt-out of such disclosure.
